    <h2><u>3.Proposed Solution</u></h2>
    <p>
      "The river cleaning robot offers a dual-function solution: waste
      collection and water quality monitoring through pH sensing."<br />

      <b>Autonomous Navigation:</b> The robot uses GPS and computer vision to
      autonomously navigate rivers, avoiding obstacles and targeting
      high-pollution areas. This helps in targeting hotspots for debris
      collection and pollution monitoring.<br />
      <b>Waste Collection System:</b> The robot uses a mechanical roller and
      nets to capture floating litter and solid debris. It ensures efficient
      removal of pollutants, addressing both plastics and organic waste​s.<br />
      <b>pH Sensing:</b> Continuous water quality monitoring is done through pH
      sensors, which provide data on acidity or alkalinity. This data is crucial
      for detecting pollution and harmful substances in real-time.<br />
      <b>Modular Design:</b> The robot’s modularity ensures easy maintenance and
      future upgrades, making it a sustainable solution.
