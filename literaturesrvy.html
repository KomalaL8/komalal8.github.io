    <h2><u> 1. Literature Survey </u></h2>
    <p>
      A river cleaning robot is a specialized autonomous or remotely operated
      device designed to clean and maintain rivers and other water bodies. These
      robots are equipped with various technologies and features to remove
      debris, pollutants, and other environmental contaminants from the water.
      Here are some common features and technologies associated with river
      cleaning robots:<br />

      <b>Sensors:</b> River cleaning robots are equipped with a variety of
      sensors to detect and identify different types of pollutants and debris in
      the water. These sensors can include cameras, infrared sensors, and
      chemical sensors to analyze water quality. <br /><b
        >Collection Mechanisms: </b
      >River cleaning robots are equipped with mechanisms for collecting and
      removing debris from the water. This can include nets, scoops, conveyor
      belts, or other systems designed to capture and store pollutants.
      Filtration<br />

      <b>Systems:</b> Some robots incorporate filtration systems to remove
      smaller particles and pollutants from the water. These systems can include
      mesh filters or advanced filtration technologies to improve water
      quality.<br />

      <b>Remote Operation:</b> In addition to autonomous operation, some river
      cleaning robots can be remotely operated by human operators. This allows
      for more precise control in challenging or dynamic environments.<br /><b
        >Energy Sources</b
      >
      River cleaning robots may be powered by rechargeable batteries, solar
      panels, or a combination of both. Using renewable energy sources helps
      reduce the environmental impact and allows for longer operational
      periods.<br /><b>Communication Systems:</b> River cleaning robots often
      have communication systems to send real-time data and status updates to a
      central control system or human operators. This enables monitoring of the
      robot's performance and facilitates timely decision-making.<br /><b
        >Adaptability:</b
      >
      The design of river cleaning robots may allow them to adapt to different
      river environments, including varying water depths, currents, and types of
      debris. This adaptability enhances their effectiveness in diverse
      conditions.<br /><b>Navigation Systems:</b> Autonomous river cleaning
      robots use navigation systems such as GPS and advanced algorithms to
      navigate through the water and reach specific locations. This allows them
      to cover large areas efficiently.
