    <h2><u>4.Future Scope</u></h2>
    <p>
      Can be modified to Detect the waste automatically and collect it. Separate
      the bio degradable and non bio degradable waste from the river. In future
      this project can be improved to sort more categories of waste. In this
      framework we can utilize advance transport framework and transport
      material for expanding the productivity of accumulation of refuse. We can
      utilize the sun oriented board for giving capacity to the vessel rather
      than battery activity.
