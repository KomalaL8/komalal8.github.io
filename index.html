      "The increasing water pollution in lakes, ponds, and other water resources
      impacted by human activities presents a significant challenge for society.
      Clean, safe, and pollution-free water is essential for a range of human
      needs, yet the lack of accessible and affordable equipment for pollution
      control makes it difficult to maintain these water bodies. This has
      underscored the need for developing efficient and cost-effective
      solutions, such as an autonomous water surface cleaning robot, designed
      specifically to address this growing environmental concern."
